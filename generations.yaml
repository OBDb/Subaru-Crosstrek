    description: "The first-generation Subaru Crosstrek (initially called the XV Crosstrek in North America until 2015) was essentially a lifted and ruggedized version of the Impreza hatchback, positioned as a compact crossover SUV. Built on the same platform as the fourth-generation Impreza, the Crosstrek featured a raised suspension providing 8.7 inches of ground clearance (3.7 inches more than the standard Impreza), unique 17-inch wheels, more aggressive body cladding, and roof rails as standard equipment. Powered by a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter flat-four 'boxer' engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, the Crosstrek came standard with Subaru's Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system paired with either a five-speed manual or Lineartronic continuously variable transmission (CVT). In 2014, a gas-electric hybrid variant was introduced in select markets, combining the 2.0-liter engine with a 13.4 horsepower electric motor for marginally improved fuel economy but limited electric-only operation. The interior was largely identical to the Impreza, featuring a straightforward, functional design with cloth or optional leather seating, a multi-function display atop the center stack, and available features including navigation, heated seats, and a power moonroof. The cargo area offered 22.3 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats, expanding to 51.9 cubic feet with the rear seats foldedâ€”modest for a crossover but practical for its compact exterior dimensions. Standard safety features included seven airbags, anti-lock brakes, and stability control, with Subaru's EyeSight driver assistance system becoming available later in the generation. The first-generation Crosstrek successfully captured buyers looking for light off-road capability and all-weather performance in a compact, efficient package, appealing particularly to outdoor enthusiasts and those living in regions with challenging weather conditions."

    end_year: 2022
    description: "The second-generation Subaru Crosstrek was built on the Subaru Global Platform first introduced with the fifth-generation Impreza, offering increased rigidity, improved crash protection, and enhanced ride quality. Following the same formula as its predecessor, the new Crosstrek maintained its lifted stance with 8.7 inches of ground clearance but featured more refined styling with a more prominent grille, hawk-eye headlights, and more sophisticated body cladding, while maintaining clear visual connections to the Impreza hatchback upon which it was based. Initially powered by the same 2.0-liter flat-four 'boxer' engine as before, now producing 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, the Crosstrek was offered with either a six-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT), both paired with Subaru's Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system. Responding to feedback that the previous model was underpowered, Subaru added an optional 2.5-liter flat-four producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque for higher trim levels beginning in 2021. A plug-in hybrid variant called the Crosstrek Hybrid (or Crosstrek e-Boxer in some markets) combined a 2.0-liter engine with electric motors and a small battery enabling approximately 17 miles of electric-only operation. The interior saw significant improvements with higher quality materials, a more modern design, and enhanced technology including a standard 6.5-inch or available 8-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Cargo capacity increased slightly to 20.8 cubic feet behind the rear seats, expanding to 55.3 cubic feet with the seats folded. Safety features expanded substantially with Subaru's EyeSight driver assistance system becoming standard on all CVT-equipped models, offering adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, lane departure warning, and lane-keeping assist. The second-generation Crosstrek built upon the success of its predecessor with improved refinement, enhanced technology, and a broader range of powertrain options, further establishing itself as a popular choice in the increasingly competitive compact crossover segment."

    description: "The third-generation Subaru Crosstrek, introduced for the 2023 model year, continues the model's successful formula as a lifted, ruggedized compact crossover based on the latest Impreza platform, but with more distinctive styling and features to further differentiate it from its hatchback sibling. The exterior design features a more aggressive appearance with a larger grille, redesigned headlights, more prominent wheel arch cladding, and an overall more substantial presence, though the basic shape and dimensions remain similar to the previous generation. Ground clearance remains a class-leading 8.7 inches, maintaining the model's off-road capability. Engine options include a revised 2.0-liter flat-four 'boxer' producing 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque in base models, and a 2.5-liter flat-four developing 182 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque in higher trim levels. Both engines are paired with Subaru's Lineartronic continuously variable transmission (CVT) and Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system, with the manual transmission option eliminated in the North American market. A hybrid variant continues in select markets. The interior features a more upscale design with improved materials, a standard 7-inch or available 11.6-inch vertical touchscreen infotainment system, and expanded connectivity options including wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Cargo space remains practical at approximately 20 cubic feet behind the rear seats and 55 cubic feet with the seats folded. Safety technology has been enhanced with the latest version of Subaru's EyeSight driver assistance system now standard across all models, featuring improved cameras with a wider field of view and enhanced processing for more natural-feeling operation in various driving conditions. New available features include a 360-degree camera system, wireless smartphone charging, and dual-zone automatic climate control. The third-generation Crosstrek has evolved to more clearly establish its own identity separate from the Impreza, reflecting the market shift toward crossovers and SUVs, while maintaining the all-weather capability, practicality, and safety focus that has made it Subaru's best-selling model in many markets."
