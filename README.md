# Subaru Crosstrek

This repository contains signal set configurations for the Subaru Crosstrek, organized by model year and version. The files are structured to allow for easy differentiation between model generations and other vehicle parameters, ensuring accurate signal mapping for each version of the Subaru Crosstrek.

## Generations

The Subaru Crosstrek has gone through three main generations:

- **First Generation (2013-2017)**: Initially launched as the XV Crosstrek in North America, this model was based on the Impreza hatchback but with increased ground clearance (8.7 inches) and more rugged styling. The first generation featured a 2.0-liter boxer engine producing 148 hp, paired with either a five-speed manual transmission or a Lineartronic CVT. In 2014, Subaru introduced a hybrid version that combined the 2.0-liter engine with an electric motor, but it was discontinued after the 2016 model year. For the 2016 model year in the US and Canada, Subaru dropped the "XV" prefix, marketing it simply as the Crosstrek.

- **Second Generation (2018-2023)**: Built on Subaru's Global Platform, the second generation Crosstrek continued with the same boxer engine concept but with improvements. The base 2.0-liter engine was upgraded to produce 152 hp, and transmission options included a six-speed manual or a CVT. For the 2019 model year, Subaru introduced a plug-in hybrid variant with 17 miles of electric-only range in select markets. A significant update came for the 2021 model year when Subaru introduced a more powerful 2.5-liter engine option producing 182 hp for the Sport and Limited trims, addressing long-standing complaints about the vehicle being underpowered.

- **Third Generation (2024-present)**: Fully redesigned while maintaining its rugged character, the third generation Crosstrek adopted the "Crosstrek" name globally (dropping the "XV" designation in all markets). Engine options include the carried-over 2.0-liter (152 hp) and 2.5-liter (182 hp) boxer engines. With this generation, Subaru eliminated the manual transmission option, making the CVT standard across all trims. New for this generation is the introduction of the more off-road oriented Wilderness trim, featuring increased ground clearance and all-terrain tires for improved capability in challenging conditions.
